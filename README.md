NOTE: the main web API being used (for standings and club info) has a call limit of 10 calls per minute.

Deployed App: https://footerfront.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies

This web application was built using the MERN (Mongodb Express React Node) stack. Two public APIs were used: Scorebat API and Football-Data API. For authorization, I used Auth0. Both the server and client were deployed via heroku.

## Original Wireframes

This was the original wireframe. During production, there were significant changes in the look of the header and the main container. Submit any issues to let me know what you think.
